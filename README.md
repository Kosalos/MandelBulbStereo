# MandelBulbStereo
MandelBulb Point Cloud in stereo 3D, using Swift and Metal.

MandelBulbQuad works okay to render a point cloud rendition of the MandelBulb
(Quad because you can interleave up to 4 clouds to get greater point density),

but this version is much better becvause the cloud is rendered in stereo:
slightly cross your eyes to produce a third 3D image in the center.
